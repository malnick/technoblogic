Nagios is a popular monitoring framework for distributed hosts. This guide explains how to monitor a DC/OS cluster with [Nagios Core 4x](https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/monitoring-linux.html) using [NRPE](https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/addons.html#nrpe).

## Installation
This guide assumes you've installed and configured Nagios for your cluster. Below are links to popular configuration management suites to help with that.

- Puppet Module: [thias/nagios](https://forge.puppet.com/thias/nagios)
- Chef Cookbook: [schubergphilis/nagios](https://github.com/schubergphilis/nagios)
- Manual Install: [Good Luck!](https://www.nagios.org/documentation/)

### Recommendations
1. Use SSL

The NRPE plugin for Nagios allows you to setup this server-daemon interface with SSL. We recommend you do this for security. 

2. Lightweight Checks

Nagios is a great tool, but don't overload your check scripts. The most common Nagios implementation error is building overly complicated scripts, and not paying attention to resource consumption the check requires. This could undermine your cluster performance. Ensure your checks are clean, require low resource overhead and make full use of the process in which they're spawned (i.e., don't pipe grep to awk). 

3. Nagios via DC/OS

We ***do not*** recommend running Nagios via DC/OS. There are popular containers to run Nagios, and you can theoretically run Nagios on DC/OS via one of [these containers](https://github.com/cpuguy83/docker-nagios).

However, guaranteeing that DC/OS will spawn the container on every host correctly is tricky, and if the thing you're monitoring is also responsible for running your monitoring platform, you'll most likely end up a sad operator when that thing goes down, since your monitoring platform will die with it.

## What to Monitor
Once you have Nagios installed on your cluster and have the NRPE plugin configured then you can begin to construct scripts to monitor resource health for DC/OS. 

### systemd units
DC/OS runs only on systemd. Tracking units with Nagios is easy. You can use one of the popular scripts for NRPE remote checks such as [jonschipp/nagios-plugins/check_service.sh](https://github.com/jonschipp/nagios-plugins/blob/master/check_service.sh) or roll your own. 

Units differ between agent's and master's, but you can easily determine which units to monitor without hard coding these (since they are prone to changing or being added to). We can modify [jonschipp/nagios-plugins/check_service.sh](https://github.com/jonschipp/nagios-plugins/blob/master/check_service.sh) for monitoring only DC/OS units by adding a simple wrapper:

```
# cat dcos_unit_check.sh
#!/bin/bash
for unit in `ls /etc/systemd/system/dcos.target.wants`; do
  echo "Checking $unit"
  ./check_service.sh -s ${unit} > /dev/null 2>&1
  STATUS=$?
  if [ "${STATUS}" -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Status for $unit is not 0, got $STATUS"
    exit $STATUS
  fi
done
```

If a service is not healthy, such as adminrouter, we will get a failure from this script:

```
ip-10-0-6-126 core # ./dcos_unit_check.sh
Checking dcos-adminrouter-reload.service
Status for dcos-adminrouter-reload.service is not 0, got 2 
```

### Docker
Monitoring Docker via Nagios can be tricky, as there are many aspects you might want to watch. If your intent is to monitor the service is available and running, (i.e., Docker service is running and enabled and healthy according to systemd) then we recommend a NRPE script that does just that.

If your intent is to monitor what is going on inside the container, we recommend you run a service such as [cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor).
