# Puppet Webhook 
Have you ever needed to implement a simple REST API call to another service after a puppet run or during? 

Well now you can!

This module contains a ```http``` type which can be ensureed to GET or POST. At the time of this writing the POST route has not been completed, however the GET route is implemnted as:

```
http { 'the_route':
    ensure  => get,
    fqdn    => 'your.domain.com',
    port    => '6969',
}
```

This construction will essentially execute:

```
curl http://your.domain.com:6969/the_route
```

### Real world example
Ok great, now we have an access point to the ruby HTTP lib from Puppet. Now what? Well, eventually you'll be able to do something like this:

```
http { 'my_api':
    ensure  => post,
    fqdn    => 'your.domain.com',
    port    => '6969',
    data    => {
        'my_key'        => 'some_value',
        'another_key'   => $::some_fact,
    }
    header  => 'application/json', # or maybe javascript? or whatever your hook expects...
}
```

Now that's a more complex example. What if all I want to do is execute a puppet run on my haproxy node after new nodes come up behind it?

Sure, there are a lot of ways we could accomplish this. I think the agreed upon way would be to use mCollective. mCollective is great since it rolls on Apache's ActiveMQ message bus. What that means is mCollective is **asynchronous** in messsaging. In other words, if we set up a webhook on our haproxy node to run ```puppet agent -t``` whenever a route recieves a GET request. However, we'd end up having a race condition on the puppet process itself; if puppet is already running when a new node comes up it will fail to implement the call to run puppet on the haproxy node since that call is synchronous.

mCollective's AMQ bus allows us to stick a message on the bus to run puppet if it can't execute puppet right away, like when the puppet process is already running and the lock file exists. 

So, the question remains: how do I execute a puppet run on our haproxy node, in order to get its fresh external resources (haproxy members) when new nodes come up? 

Well, we could have a run stage at the end of our role (for the new node which will be a haproxy member)  manifest for the class containing our ```http``` resource: 

Given a role of ```haproxy_member_backend_service```:

```
class roles::haproxy_member_backend_service {
    stage { 'last':
        requires => Stage['main'],
    }

    #... a bunch of code

    class { 'profiles::update_loadbalancer':
        stage => 'last',
    }
}
```

...and a update_loadbalancer profiles like:

```
class profiles::update_loadbalancer {
    
    http { 'update_loadbalancer':
        ensure  => get,
        port    => '6969',
        fqdn    => 'my.puppetmaster.com',
    }
}
```

We can implement a webhook profile that is included in our puppetmaster module (or role, if your puppetmaster doesn't need a lot of configuration like mine) like this (which uses the handy ```webhook::listener``` defined type) to build out a dynamically generated sinatra server:

```
class puppetmaster::webhook {

    include webhook
    webhook::listener {'puppet':
        port => '6969',
        routes            => { 
            'kick_haproxy_app_internal'  => {
                'method'  => 'get',
                'command' => "su - peadmin -c 'mco puppet runonce -F role=haproxy_app_internal'"
            },
        }
    }
}
```

That ```webhook::listener``` builds a sinatra server at ```/usr/local/bin/webhook_puppet/```. It looks like this:

```
require 'rubygems'
require 'rack'
require 'sinatra'
require 'webrick'
require 'logger'

# Global vars
LOGDIR              = File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__)) + '/../logs'
SERVER_LOGFILE  = LOGDIR + '/server.log'
SESSION_LOG         = LOGDIR + '/session.log'

# Reset some envs
ENV['HOME']     = '/root'
ENV['PATH']     = '/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/opt/puppet/bin'
ENV['RACK_ENV'] = 'production'

# Implement an access log for robust logging of user info and access and git output
LOG = Logger.new(SESSION_LOG)
LOG.info("Setting session log at #{SESSION_LOG}")
LOG.info("Setting server log at #{SERVER_LOGFILE}")

# Server options
opts = {
    :Port               => 6969,
    :Logger             => WEBrick::Log::new(SERVER_LOGFILE, WEBrick::Log::DEBUG),
    :ServerType         => WEBrick::Daemon,
    :SSLEnable          => false,
}

class Server < Sinatra::Base


    get '/kick_haproxy_app_internal' do
        IO.popen("su - peadmin -c 'mco puppet runonce -F role=haproxy_app_internal'") do |output|
            output.each do |line| LOG.info(line.strip.chomp) end
        end
    end


    not_found do
        halt 404, 'You shall not pass! (page not found)'
    end
end

Rack::Handler::WEBrick.run(Server, opts) do |server|
    [:INT, :TERM].each { |sig| trap(sig) { server.stop } }
end
```

You can add as many routes as you'd like to the ```routes``` parameter in the ```webhook::listener``` define. It's great for quickly building and codifying your API infrastructure. For now, it only works with very simple things like 'I need to run this arbitrary command on a box on POST or GET', but I'm going to build it out with more complex routes as defautls such as:

* Accept a POST from jenkins with the ```environmnent```, ```role``` and ```version``` of a given build. Based on that post, update the hiera data as needed and re-run puppet on the box that is assigned the ```role``` in the given ```environmnent```. 

With a route like that you can setup a CI hook from your build environment in Jenkins (using any of the HTTP plugins for Jenkins) with Puppet very easily.

### ...back to the point ...

So now we have this webhook running on our Puppet Master. The webhook accepts a route at ```http://mymaster.com:6969/kick_haproxy_app_internal``` and upon receiving a GET request it will execute an mCollective command to ```puppet runonce``` on the node whose ```$::role``` fact matches ```haproxy_app_internal```. If you guessed that ```haproxy_app_internal``` is the role for our internal loadbalancer then congrats, you've won nothing but please come back and play again.

At the end of our role manifest for the node which will be a ```balancermember``` behind this loadbalancer we have set up a run stage that excutes last, which leverages the ```http``` resource, ensured to GET at the specified route to the webhook running on our master. Now, when nodes assined that role ```haproxy_member_backend_service``` come up, they kick our webhook on the master which generates an asynchronous call on mCollective to hick the loadbalancer which pulls down the exported ```balancermember``` resources. 

THIS IS AMAZING IF YOU'RE RUNNING AWS AUTOSCALING GROUPS

I'm not sure why that needed to be in all caps. Maybe you'll understand if you have haproxy running in front of an autoscaling group, you'll realize why I'M SO EXCITED.

### Where I'm going to take this...
I'm going to add the above mentioned route for Jenkins as an optional default. That route is the glue that ties in how we execute puppet runs via MCO when new builds are pushed down the pipeline. The flow would look something like this:

```
On my.jenkins.com, final build process is: 

    POST my.puppetmaster.com {
        'environment'   = 'production',
        'role           = 'some_micro_service_backend',
        'version        = '2.1.4'
    }

On my.puppetmaster.com, upon receiving POST from my.jenkins.com with the above JSON: 

    1. Update hieradata at /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/#{environment}/roles/#{role}.yaml 
    with the correct #{version} from jenkins.
    2. Commit the new version and push back up to our control repo where hieradata dir actually resides. 
    3. Execute:
        
        mco puppet runonce -F 'role=#{role}' 
```

Boom, we just implemented and end-to-end CI chain from our Jenkins build process, which updated our Puppet Master with the new version of the micro service, which pushed the version to git, and ran puppet on the node whose role matches the micro service being updated. 

In our infrastructure the profile for the micro service executes a ```s3file``` resource to pull down the build which matches:

```
s3file { 'micro_service_${version}:
    path    => '/some/bucket/',
    ensure  => latest,
}
```

When the node consuming the ```mco puppet runonce``` publication runs puppet, that profile ensures we get the latest revision of our code. d
